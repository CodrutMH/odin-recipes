    <img src="/imgs/carbonara.jpg" alt="" />
    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      This rich pasta toss is great for everyday dinners or special occasions. I
      can come home from work and throw this dish together in a half hour.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups rigatoni pasta</li>
      <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh green peas</li>
      <li>¼ cup diced cooked ham</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to follow:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook guanciale with olive oil and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a
        Dutch oven over medium-low heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes.
        Reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs, 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 3 tablespoons
        Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked
        through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate pan, cook bacon until crispy. Remove excess grease,
        leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan. Add crushed red pepper flakes and
        cook for an additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the reserved pasta water and drained spaghetti into the
        bacon-pepper mixture. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly pour the egg mixture into the pasta mixture while stirring
        constantly. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the egg mixture forms a thick
        sauce. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir remaining 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 3
        tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese into the pasta mixture and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
